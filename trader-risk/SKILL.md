name: trader-risk
description: >-
  Risk Manager. Checks every trade against your limits and stops anything
  over them, before you place it in Kite. For a day trade: a stop is
  required, the loss at the stop must fit your max loss per trade (measured
  from the higher of the plan's entry and a fresh price), reward:risk must
  meet your minimum, the day's total risk must fit your daily loss limit, no
  more than your trades per day, and no new entries outside your entry
  window or when the market is closed. It also keeps the basics: blocked
  tickers, order size, position cap, cash buffer, margin, short sales,
  options and crypto, malformed or bad bracket orders, duplicates and a daily
  order limit. Getting out is never blocked by a day limit. Prints PASS or
  BLOCK with the reason and records the verdicts so trader-broker only shows
  an order that passed. Use when the user says "check my order", "is this
  safe", "risk check", "does this break my rules", "can I take this trade",
  "how much have I risked today", or before /trader-broker, always.

# trader-risk

The Risk Manager is the gate between a proposal and your own Kite order. Every order
written by trader-budget or trader-broker's flatten passes through it. A
BLOCK is final for that order: it does not go to the user, and you
should not place it in Kite. Most people who day trade lose money. These limits
keep each loss and each day's losses small. They do not make a trade win.

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` below is this skill's folder (where this SKILL.md lives).

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/check.py"                           # trader/ files; writes trader/state/risk.json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/check.py" --json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/check.py" --no-write                # look without recording
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/check.py" --now "2026-11-06 10:15"  # pin the clock (IST)
```

## What it reads and writes

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `trader/orders.json` | the proposed orders (trader-budget, or trader-broker's flatten) |
| `trader/config.json` | the limits (trader-budget ships `config.example.json`) |
| `trader/portfolio.json` | cash and holdings; if missing, a fresh account funded with the budget |
| `trader/prices.json` | a fresh price raises the entry it measures risk from; also values holdings |
| `trader/state/broker.json` | what was placed today: duplicates, trades per day, daily loss, day trades |
| `trader/state/risk.json` | the verdicts it writes, with a fingerprint of each exact order |

## Entries and exits

An **entry** opens or adds to a position: a buy, or a sell that would go
short. An **exit** only reduces what you already hold. Getting out must
always be possible, so an exit is checked for format, asset and short sales
only. Every other rule (day limits, entry window, loss, reward:risk, blocked
list, size, duplicates) turns into a warning for an exit, never a BLOCK.

## The checks

Orders are checked in file order, as if each passed order had filled, so a
batch that is fine order by order but breaks a limit together is caught.

| check | blocks when |
| --- | --- |
| format | no symbol, side not buy or sell, both or neither of qty and notional, a notional order that is not market + day, a limit order with no limit price; a bracket that is not whole shares, not `day` or `gtc`, or misses its stop-loss or take-profit |
| asset | an option symbol while `allow_options` is false; crypto or anything that is not a plain NSE equity symbol (letters, digits, & and -) |
| short | a sell of more than you hold (`allow_short` false) |
| blocked | (entries) the ticker is on the `blocked` list |
| size | (entries) under `min_order_inr` or over `max_order_inr` |
| position | (entries) the stock would be over `max_position_pct` of the account |
| cash | (entries) the buy would leave less than the cash buffer, or need margin |
| stop | (entries) no stop while `require_stop` is true (a bracket `stop_loss_stop_price`, or the order's plan stop); a stop on the wrong side of the entry |
| loss | (entries) qty x (entry minus stop) over `max_loss_per_trade_inr` |
| reward:risk | (entries) (target minus entry) / (entry minus stop) under `min_reward_risk` |
| daily loss | (entries) the max losses at the stops of today's entries, plus this one, over `max_daily_loss_inr` |
| trades | (entries) `max_trades_per_day` entries already placed today |
| window | (entries) before `no_entries_before` or after `no_entries_after`, or the market is closed |
| duplicate | (entries) the same symbol and side twice in one batch, or already placed today |
| daily limit | (entries) `max_orders_per_day` orders already placed today |

How the numbers work:

- **The entry it measures from**: the limit price for a limit order. For a
  market order, the HIGHER of the plan's entry and a fresh price from
  `trader/prices.json` (under 15 minutes old). A plan written at 10:15 cannot
  understate the risk at 10:55 after the price ran up. An older price is not
  used, and it says so.
- **Daily loss** counts the full max loss of every entry placed today, win or
  lose, as trader-broker logged it. Three full-size trades use up a ₹1,500 day.
- **The window** is IST, worked out in the tool (no daylight saving in India), never from the computer's clock zone. Weekends and NSE holidays
  are closed. NSE has no scheduled early close.
  Set both `no_entries_*` to null to switch the window off.
- **No pattern-day-trader rule.** India has no US-style PDT rule, so there is no day-trade count to guard.
  (The code still reads an old `pdt_guard` key if you set it; leave it off.)

Warnings do not block, but say them to the user: a number
sent as a number instead of a string, a stop that lives only in the plan and
not placed in Kite, a price too old to use.

## Steps

1. If the price may have moved since the plan, refresh it first
   (trader-alerts: `alerts.py quote RELIANCE --write`).
2. Run `check.py`. Exit code 0 means every order passed, 1 means at least one
   was blocked.
3. Tell the user the result in plain words, order by order: the max loss at
   the stop, reward:risk, and how much of today's limits it uses. For a
   BLOCK, give the reason and the fix (fewer shares, a closer stop from
   trader-exit, wait for the window, or skip the trade). Never change a
   limit yourself.
4. If the order changes in any way, run the check again. trader-broker matches
   each order to its verdict by fingerprint, so an edited order is not ready
   until it passes again, and a verdict from yesterday does not count today.

## Example: a live run on the NSE

The RELIANCE bracket from trader-budget at 10:30 AM on Friday 2026-11-06, with the example config:

```
PASS  #1 buy RELIANCE 45 shares, entry
          entry 1311.90 (the plan's entry), stop 1300.80, target 1323.00: risk 11.10 a share
          max loss ₹499.50 (limit ₹500), reward:risk 1.00 (min 1)
          today before this: 0 of 3 trades, ₹0 of ₹1,500 daily loss

1 passed, 0 blocked at 2026-11-06 10:30 IST. Cash after the passed orders: ₹40,964.50.
```

The same order checked at 09:20 is BLOCKED by the window (no new entries before
09:30 IST); at 15:05 it is blocked (no new entries after 15:00); on Tuesday
2026-11-10 it is blocked because the NSE is closed (Diwali-Balipratipada). All
three were run for this file. A sell that closes a position you hold is an exit
and passes even after the entry cutoff.

## Rules

- A PASS only means the order breaks none of your rules. It is not advice and not a signal.
- Every number comes from the config, the order, the portfolio, the prices or the broker log.
- Free Yahoo prices are unofficial and can lag; the price Kite fills at is the one that counts, and a
  stop can fill worse than its price in a fast market.

## What it never does

It never places an order, never edits an order to make it pass, never
loosens a limit, never blocks a sell that only gets the user out, and never
treats a PASS as a recommendation.

## Safety

- Education and tooling, not financial advice. A PASS is a rules check, not a recommendation.
- No skill in this pack places an order. You place every order yourself in Zerodha Kite; trader-broker
  only prints the ticket for an order that trader-risk passed today.
- No margin, short selling or leverage unless the config allows it.
- Kite keys live in environment variables, never in the chat.
